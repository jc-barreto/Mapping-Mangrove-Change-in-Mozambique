Mangroves are vital coastal ecosystems found in tropical and subtropical regions. These complex habitats consist of trees and shrubs that flourish in brackish water and provide a plethora of benefits to both wildlife and humans. They are exceptional carbon sequesters and serve as nurseries for marine species, while also protecting shorelines from erosion. However, mangroves are under threat from human activities such as deforestation, urbanization, and aquaculture, as well as the impacts of climate change, including sea level rise and intensified storms. This study focuses on analyzing the evolution of the mangrove ecosystem over time, using the Random Forest (RF) and the Support Vector Machine (SVM) method. The model considers distance to rivers and roads as significant drivers and yields an impressive accuracy of 99%. The analysis is conducted as part of the MozambES project, which aims to promote sustainable management of mangrove ecosystems in Sofala Province and enhance the livelihoods of rural communities. By providing insight into the changes in mangrove ecosystems, this study will contribute to the project's goal of improving the management and conservation of these vital coastal habitats.
